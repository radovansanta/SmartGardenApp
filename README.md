## Description
Let’s imagine having a garden with a nice lawn or maybe flowers as well. It requires a lot of needed treatment, that you have to do by yourself. But there could be a way to make it easier using the mobile app called SmartGarden.

The main purpose of the app is controlling the water flow. One of the main equipment having in your garden are garden hoses. Up to five hoses can be easily plugged to hardware device connected to your internet. With all of these work the magic can happen.

The app will give you the possibility to open specific valve and allow water flow to hose to water the garden. 

What’s more you can easily set a timer for watering or even set a schedule.

The motivation behind the project is the own issue that transformed into the idea.
